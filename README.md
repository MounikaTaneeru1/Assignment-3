**Purpose**

To book online tickets for Dinosaur lecture.
Order forms are documents that describe requests for services. In our case the order form is deployed to book online tickets. An order form must be informational. The main use of an order form is to organize any request that client makes. 
**Steps to build Project:**

**A. Choose a form builder tool.** 

For this project I have choosed a form builder that is responsive, easy, and that doesn't demand much time to use. Also, you must prefer the one that has a payment system integrated into it, since it makes it easier for you to collect payments. I have Visual Studio Code application to build this project

**B . Customize the form with proper fields**

When choosing the fields you must answer questions like:
- What information do you need from the user?
- What do you need to know about the order or the service?
- What can you do for the customer?

**C. Add photos of the products**

It is interesting to add photos of the project you are conducting along with its description. That can help the user to associate the purchas0e better. And, depending on the kind of service you are offering, you can also display photos from your portfolio.

**D. Customize the order form with branding**

When thinking about lead generation it is important to create branding. Add elements that address your business. This can help customers and prospects associate those elements to the business.

**E. Set up a payment method**

This is an important step in the process of building an order form. After all, you must get paid for the service or product you are offering. And you can do it through the system of your trust. There are a lot of online services for payment. Or maybe you prefer to offer a credit card charge or bank deposit. Decide which method is the best option for your business and add it to the order form.

 **F. Set up  a success message**
 
 Donâ€™t leave  your customer on hold. Set up an automatic message to be sent after the lead submits the form. Success messages are an excellent way to keep the lead informed about if their request was sent properly. 
 
**Steps to run project:**

The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.
